# DataAnalysisProjects

Hello and welcome! These are the data analysis projects that I have completed and are listed in my portfolio website. This repository contains 3 projects: 
Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, and an Excel Project.

1) Data Exploration
This project explores real Covid-19 data in order to make some insights about how covid is affecting our population. The data was sourced from Our World in
Data (https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).

2) Data Cleaning
This project standardizes housing data in order to make it more manageable and provide greater ease-of-use. The data was sourced from Alex the Analyst
(https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Nashville%20Housing%20Data%20for%20Data%20Cleaning.xlsx).

4) Excel Project
This project standardizes data in Excel and produces pivot tables and charts to better visualize insights. The data was sourced from Alex the Analyst
(https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/Excel-Tutorial/blob/main/Excel%20Project%20Dataset.xlsx).
